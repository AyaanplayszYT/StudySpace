## Supabase Setup (SQL)

1. Go to your Supabase project > SQL Editor.
2. Run the following SQL to create tables and storage:

```sql
CREATE TABLE notes (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  title text NOT NULL,
  description text NOT NULL,
  date text NOT NULL,
  created_at timestamp DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamp
);

CREATE TABLE tasks (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  title text NOT NULL,
  description text,
  deadline text NOT NULL,
  created_at timestamp DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamp
);

ALTER TABLE notes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE tasks ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Public read notes" ON notes FOR SELECT USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Public insert notes" ON notes FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Public read tasks" ON tasks FOR SELECT USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Public insert tasks" ON tasks FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);
```

```sql
ALTER TABLE notes ADD COLUMN file_url text;
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN file_url text;

-- Allow anyone to delete notes
CREATE POLICY "Public delete notes" ON notes FOR DELETE USING (true);

-- Allow anyone to delete tasks
CREATE POLICY "Public delete tasks" ON tasks FOR DELETE USING (true);
```

## Static Hosting Instructions

1. Build your app:
	 ```sh
	 npm run build
	 ```
2. Deploy the `dist/` folder to Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or any static host.
3. All routes work via hash-based routing (`/#/admin`, `/#/dashboard`). No server rewrites needed.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```
## How can I deploy this project?

### Vercel
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel (Import Project → select repo).
2. Set Build Command: `npm run build` and Output Directory: `dist`.
3. Add environment variables under Project Settings → Environment Variables:
    - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
    - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
4. Deploy: Vercel will auto-deploy on pushes. Hash-based routing (/#/...) works without extra rules.

### Netlify
1. In Netlify, click "New site from Git" and connect your repo.
2. Configure Build Command: `npm run build` and Publish directory: `dist`.
3. Add env vars at Site settings → Build & deploy → Environment → Environment variables:
    - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
    - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
4. Alternatively, use drag-and-drop to upload the `dist/` folder after running `npm run build` locally. No rewrites required for hash routing.

### Render
1. In Render dashboard, create a new "Static Site" and connect your repo.
2. Set the Branch to deploy, Build Command: `npm run build`, and Publish Directory: `dist`.
3. Add environment variables in the Static Site settings:
    - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
    - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
4. Render will build and deploy on each push. Hash-based routing works without special configuration.

Notes:
- Always confirm the published folder is `dist` (Vite default).  
- Keep your Supabase keys secret; use each platform's environment variable settings (do not commit them to the repo).
- For previews, use the provider’s preview/deploy-from-branch features.

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.
- Select the "Codespaces" tab.
- Click on "New codespace" to launch a new Codespace environment.
- Edit files directly within the Codespace and commit and push your changes once you're done.
